# Forked project "NFC_temp" (WIP!)
This is a NFC keychain which gets its power from the NFC reader and returns the measured temperature. There is also a article by the creator of this project over at [hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/this-energy-harvesting-keychain-accessory-takes-temperatures-at-the-tap-of-a-smartphone-b571e382904c) 

## Used Components
- ATtiny1626 microcontroller (QFN20)
- RF430CL330HIRG NFC transponder (VQFN16)
- TMP117A ambient temperature sensor (DSBGA6)
